# Market Microstructure Hasbrouck Price Impact
<p>In this project, I and my group select General Electrics (GE) as our target firm. 
<p>We split the trading into XX buckets of 5 minutes.
<p>Prices are aggregated by mean, where volumes are aggregated by sum
<p>We then compute 5-minute returns and signed volume. 
<p>Next, we perform a linear regression to estimate the Hasbrouck Price Impact measure. 
<p>A graphical repsentation is also generated on the price impact dynamic through time.
